# Jupiter

Jupiter is an educational project demonstrating distributed crypto wallet generation via brute-force and elliptic curve methods. A Flask server assigns key ranges to workers who generate private keys, derive public keys and addresses, and verify them locally. Multiprocessing enables parallelism with results for "Wallet Found!" and "Almost there!".
